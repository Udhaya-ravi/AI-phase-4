## Introduction

Data visualization on a world map can offer valuable insights into geographic trends and patterns within your dataset. This README outlines a simple process to create such visualizations, focusing on splitting data into training and testing sets.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create data visualizations on a world map, you'll need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: It is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook for running the provided code. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **Required Libraries**: You'll need various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and geographic plotting. The following libraries are essential:

   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Geopandas
   - Folium
   - Scikit-learn (for splitting the data into training and testing sets)

   You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib geopandas folium scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Geospatial Data**: You will need a GeoJSON file or other geospatial data sources containing geographical shapes and information to plot on the map. You can find such data on websites like [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

5. **Data for Visualization**: Prepare your dataset to be visualized on the map. Ensure it includes geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and other relevant information for your project.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Place your geospatial data (GeoJSON or other formats) in a folder within the project directory, e.g., `data/`.

4. Update the Jupyter Notebook or Python script with the necessary file paths and data manipulation specific to your project.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file provided in the repository.

2. Follow the code cells and comments to adapt the code for your specific dataset. Make sure to adjust the paths to your data files and any dataset-specific transformations.

3. Run the notebook to visualize your data on a world map, splitting it into training and testing sets. You can customize the map styles, markers, and other visual elements as needed.

4. Use the generated map to explore the geographic distribution of your data.
